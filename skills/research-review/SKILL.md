# Research Review via External Reviewer (xhigh reasoning)

Get a multi-round critical review of research work from an external LLM with maximum reasoning depth.

## Context: $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

- **Reviewer Script** (optional but recommended): `reviewer_client.py` must be accessible via `$REVIEWER_SCRIPT` environment variable.
- This gives Claude Code access to the configured reviewer model for cross-model review.
- **If the reviewer script fails (e.g. API key not configured)**: This skill will perform the review using Claude's own critical analysis capabilities. Cross-model review via the reviewer script is preferred for objectivity, but not required.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Research Context
Before calling the external reviewer, compile a comprehensive briefing:
1. Read project narrative documents (e.g., STORY.md, README.md, paper drafts)
2. Read any memory/notes files for key findings and experiment history
3. Identify: core claims, methodology, key results, known weaknesses

### Step 2: Initial Review (Round 1)
Send a detailed prompt to the external reviewer:

```bash
# 写入评审 prompt
cat << 'REVIEW_EOF' > _review_prompt.txt
[Full research context + specific questions]
Please act as a senior ML reviewer (NeurIPS/ICML level). Identify:
1. Logical gaps or unjustified claims
2. Missing experiments that would strengthen the story
3. Narrative weaknesses
4. Whether the contribution is sufficient for a top venue
Please be brutally honest.
REVIEW_EOF

# 调用外部评审模型
PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null)
$PYTHON "$REVIEWER_SCRIPT" --prompt-file _review_prompt.txt --thread-file _reviewer_thread.json
```

### Step 3: Iterative Dialogue (Rounds 2-N)
Use `reviewer_client.py` with the same `--thread-file` to continue the conversation (对话历史通过 `_reviewer_thread.json` 自动保存):

For each round:
1. **Respond** to criticisms with evidence/counterarguments
2. **Ask targeted follow-ups** on the most actionable points
3. **Request specific deliverables**: experiment designs, paper outlines, claims matrices

```bash
cat << 'REVIEW_EOF' > _review_prompt.txt
[follow-up content for this round]
REVIEW_EOF

PYTHON=$(command -v python3 2>/dev/null || command -v python 2>/dev/null)
$PYTHON "$REVIEWER_SCRIPT" --prompt-file _review_prompt.txt --thread-file _reviewer_thread.json
```

Key follow-up patterns:
- "If we reframe X as Y, does that change your assessment?"
- "What's the minimum experiment to satisfy concern Z?"
- "Please design the minimal additional experiment package (highest acceptance lift per GPU week)"
- "Please write a mock NeurIPS/ICML review with scores"
- "Give me a results-to-claims matrix for possible experimental outcomes"

### Step 4: Convergence
Stop iterating when:
- Both sides agree on the core claims and their evidence requirements
- A concrete experiment plan is established
- The narrative structure is settled

### Step 5: Document Everything
Save the full interaction and conclusions to **`review_report.md`** in the project root:
- Round-by-round summary of criticisms and responses
- Final consensus on claims, narrative, and experiments
- Claims matrix (what claims are allowed under each possible outcome)
- Prioritized TODO list with estimated compute costs
- Paper outline if discussed

Update project memory/notes with key review conclusions.

## Key Rules

- **⛔ File writing strategy (prevent both failure modes):**
  - review_report.md is typically short (<150 lines) → **use the Write tool directly (atomic, reliable)**
  - If content is very long (multi-round dialogue > 150 lines) → Write the first section (ensures file exists), then `cat << 'EOF' >> review_report.md` to append remaining sections
  - **NEVER end_turn without writing the report** — even if the reviewer script fails, write a report using your own analysis
- Send comprehensive context in Round 1 — the external model cannot read your files
- Be honest about weaknesses — hiding them leads to worse feedback
- Push back on criticisms you disagree with, but accept valid ones
- Focus on ACTIONABLE feedback — "what experiment would fix this?"
- 对话历史通过 `_reviewer_thread.json` 自动保存，可随时恢复
- The review document should be self-contained (readable without the conversation)

⛔ **MUST run output verification before ending**:
```bash
PASS=true
[ -f review_report.md ] && SZ=$(wc -c < review_report.md) || SZ=0
if [ "$SZ" -ge 800 ]; then
    echo "✅ review_report.md ($SZ bytes)"
else
    echo "❌ review_report.md missing or too small ($SZ bytes) — use Write tool to create it NOW"
    PASS=false
fi
[ "$PASS" != true ] && echo "⛔ Verification failed — must write report before ending step"
```

## Prompt Templates

### For initial review:
"I'm going to present a complete ML research project for your critical review. Please act as a senior ML reviewer (NeurIPS/ICML level)..."

### For experiment design:
"Please design the minimal additional experiment package that gives the highest acceptance lift per GPU week. Our compute: [describe]. Be very specific about configurations."

### For paper structure:
"Please turn this into a concrete paper outline with section-by-section claims and figure plan."

### For claims matrix:
"Please give me a results-to-claims matrix: what claim is allowed under each possible outcome of experiments X and Y?"

### For mock review:
"Please write a mock NeurIPS review with: Summary, Strengths, Weaknesses, Questions for Authors, Score, Confidence, and What Would Move Toward Accept."
